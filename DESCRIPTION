Description: An implementation of a constrained sparse additive regression for modeling interaction effects between a categorical treatment variable and a set of pretreatment covariates on a scalar-valued outcome; the regression simultaneousely conducts treatment effect-modifier variable selection. The method can effectively identify treatment effect-modifiers exhibiting possibly nonlinear interactions with the treatment. The selected pretreatment characteristics and the associated nonzero component functions can be used as a new set of data-driven features for making individualized treatment recommendations in further analysis. We refer to Park, Petkova, Tarpey, and Ogden (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2019.05.008> and Park, Petkova, Tarpey, and Ogden (2020) "A constrained sparse additive model for treatment effect-modifier selection" (pre-print) for detail of the method. The wrapper function of this package is cv.samTEMsel().
